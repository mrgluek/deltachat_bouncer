# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-05-11
### Added
- Added `/relays` command to find group members using regular mail providers (Yandex, Mail.ru, Rambler). Available to all users with a 10-minute cooldown.
- Added `/contact<ID>` command to share contact objects via dynamic links in reports.
- Enhanced all reports with rich formatting (bold names, square brackets for timestamps) and contact links.
- Enhanced `/relays` to automatically extract secondary addresses (transports) for all contacts by parsing encryption info.
- Added daily status reports (heartbeats) that post group statistics even if no one is inactive yet.
- Added `/top` command to show the most active members in the last 24 hours. Available to all users with a 10-minute cooldown.
- Enhanced all reports with rich formatting (bold names, square brackets for timestamps), contact links, and activity rankings.
### Changed
- Improved background loop diagnostics by logging specific errors for all RPC fallback methods.
- Fixed critical bug in `/contact<ID>` command by implementing manual vCard generation and sharing (resolved `MsgData` and `MessageViewtype` incompatibilities).
- Fixed `last_seen` extraction for contacts by properly handling `AttrDict` and dictionary fallbacks.
- Reduced log noise by changing admin fingerprint mismatch warnings to info level.

## [1.3.1] - 2026-05-12
### Changed
- Reduced inactivity threshold from 30 days to 7 days for more aggressive group management.
- Removed activity ranking from manual `/bounce` reports to keep them focused (ranking is still available via `/top`).
- Updated reports to dynamically reflect the current inactivity threshold in days.
### Fixed
- Fixed "Method not found" error in daily inactivity check by expanding RPC method fallbacks (added `get_chat_list_ids`).
